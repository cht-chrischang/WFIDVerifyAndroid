/Users/chrischang/work/moda/demo/WFIDVerifyAndroid/app/build.gradle:12: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk 34
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application or sdk runs on a version of Android that is more
   recent than your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with,
   various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application
   continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the
   targetSdkVersion is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the
   UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/Users/chrischang/work/moda/demo/WFIDVerifyAndroid/app/src/main/java/com/example/wfidverify/MainActivity.java:40: Warning: Using setJavaScriptEnabled can introduce XSS vulnerabilities into your application, review carefully [SetJavaScriptEnabled]
        webSettings.setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "SetJavaScriptEnabled":
   Your code should not invoke setJavaScriptEnabled if you are not sure that
   your app really requires JavaScript support.

/Users/chrischang/work/moda/demo/WFIDVerifyAndroid/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml:13: Warning: Unnecessary; SDK_INT is always >= 21 [ObsoleteSdkInt]
        <item name="android:statusBarColor" tools:targetApi="l">?attr/colorPrimaryVariant</item>
                                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

/Users/chrischang/work/moda/demo/WFIDVerifyAndroid/app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml:3: Warning: The resource R.color.purple_200 appears to be unused [UnusedResources]
    <color name="purple_200">#FFBB86FC</color>
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.

/Users/chrischang/work/moda/demo/WFIDVerifyAndroid/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:8: Warning: Should explicitly set android:icon, there is no default [MissingApplicationIcon]
    <application
     ~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "MissingApplicationIcon":
   You should set an icon for the application as whole because there is no
   default. This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource
   containing the image (for example @drawable/icon).

/Users/chrischang/work/moda/demo/WFIDVerifyAndroid/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml:26: Warning: Hardcoded string "載入", should use @string resource [HardcodedText]
        android:text="載入"
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "HardcodedText":
   Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several
   reasons:

   * When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or
   portrait) you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when
   making changes)

   * The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding
   new translations for existing string resources.

   There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a
   resource lookup.
